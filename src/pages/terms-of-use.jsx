                    between you (&apos;User&apos;, &apos;you&apos; or
                    &apos;your&apos;) and Live Proxies Inc. (&apos;Live Proxies

                    &apos;our&apos;). By accessing and using the Website and
                    Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
                    and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you
                    are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or
                    other legal entity, you represent that you have the

                    between you and Live Proxies Inc., even though it is
                    electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it
                    governs your use of the Website and Services.

                  <h2>Accounts and membership</h2>
                  <p>
                    If you create an account on the Website, you are responsible
                    for maintaining the security of your account and you are
                    fully responsible for all activities that occur under the
                    account and any other actions taken in connection with it.
                    We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new
                    accounts before you may sign in and start using the
                    Services. Providing false contact information of any kind
                    may result in the termination of your account. You must
                    immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your
                    account or any other breaches of security. We will not be
                    liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any
                    damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
                    omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account
                    (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated
                    any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or
                    content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If
                    we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may
                    not re-register for our Services. We may block your email
                    address and Internet protocol address to prevent further
                    registration.

                  <h2>Billing and payments</h2>
                  <p>
                    You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in
                    accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in
                    effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. If
                    auto-renewal is enabled for the Services you have subscribed
                    for, you will be charged automatically in accordance with
                    the term you selected. If, in our judgment, your purchase
                    constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will require you to
                    provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo
                    identification, and possibly a copy of a recent bank
                    statement for the credit or debit card used for the
                    purchase. We reserve the right to change products and
                    product pricing at any time. We also reserve the right to
                    refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole
                    discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person,
                    per household or per order. These restrictions may include
                    orders placed by or under the same customer account, the
                    same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing
                    and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change
                    to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by
                    contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number
                    provided at the time the order was made.

                    offers. We reserve the right to correct any errors,
                    inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or update
                    information or cancel orders if any information on the
                    Website or Services is inaccurate at any time without prior
                    notice (including after you have submitted your order). We
                    undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify
                    information on the Website including, without limitation,
                    pricing information, except as required by law. No specified
                    update or refresh date applied on the Website should be
                    taken to indicate that all information on the Website or
                    Services has been modified or updated.
